# MUltimodal Stress Estimation
The MUSE project is aimed at estimating, with traditional machine learning, if a person is stressed or not from biometrics data, specifically:
- ElectroCardioGram (ECG)
- Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
- Skin Temperature (ST)

The project is part of *The EMBC 2022 Workshop and Challenge on Detection of Stress and Mental Health Using Wearable Sensors*.
