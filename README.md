# MUltimodal Stress Estimation
The MUSE project is aimed at estimating, with traditional machine learning, if a person is stressed or not from biometrics data, specifically:
- ElectroCardioGram (ECG)
- Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
- Skin Temperature (ST)
The current repo contains the code used to run the project in a modular and re-usable way. If something is amiss, please do not hesitate to contact us.
